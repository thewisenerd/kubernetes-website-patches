-Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
-does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
-Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
-other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related
-information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no

-
-Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
-
-Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
-conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
-original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
-and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
-following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
-exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
-
-     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
-     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
-     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
-     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
-     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
-     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
-     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
-     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
-     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
-     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
-     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
-     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
-    wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors
-
-     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
-     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
-     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
-     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
-     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
-     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
-     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
-     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
-     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
-     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
-     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
-     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
-     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
-     respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations
-     for the public:

-Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
-extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are

-     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
-     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed

-     Rights.
-
-  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
-     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws

-     agreements.
-
-  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or

-     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

-     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
-
-  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
-     under this Public License.
-
-  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
-     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such

-     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
-     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
-     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
-
-  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
-     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
-
-
-Section 2 -- Scope.
-
-  a. License grant.
-
-       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
-          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
-          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
-          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
-
-            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
-               in part; and
-
-            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
-
-       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
-          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
-          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
-          its terms and conditions.
-
-       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
-          6(a).
-
-       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
-          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
-          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
-          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
-          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
-          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
-          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
-          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
-          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
-          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
-          (4) never produces Adapted Material.
-
-       5. Downstream recipients.
-
-            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
-               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
-               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
-               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
-               Public License.
-
-            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
-               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
-               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
-               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
-               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
-               Material.
-
-       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
-          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
-          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
-          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
-          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
-          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
-
-  b. Other rights.
-
-       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
-          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
-          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
-          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
-          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
-          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
-          Rights, but not otherwise.
-
-       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
-          Public License.
-
-       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
-          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
-          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
-          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
-          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
-          reserves any right to collect such royalties.
-
-
-Section 3 -- License Conditions.
-
-Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
-following conditions.
-
-  a. Attribution.
-
-       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
-          form), You must:
-
-            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
-               with the Licensed Material:
-
-                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
-                    Material and any others designated to receive
-                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
-                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
-                    designated);
-
-                ii. a copyright notice;
-
-               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
-
-                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
-                    warranties;
-
-                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
-                    extent reasonably practicable;
-
-            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
-               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
-
-            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
-               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
-               hyperlink to, this Public License.
-
-       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
-          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
-          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
-          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
-          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
-          information.
-
-       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
-          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
-          reasonably practicable.
-
-       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
-          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
-          Material from complying with this Public License.
-
-
-Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
-
-Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
-apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
-
-  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
-     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
-     portion of the contents of the database;
-
-  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
-     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
-     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
-     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
-
-  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
-     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
-
-For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
-replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
-Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
-
-
-Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
-
-  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
-     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
-     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
-     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
-     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
-     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
-     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
-     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
-     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
-     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
-
-  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
-     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
-     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
-     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
-     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
-     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
-     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
-     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
-     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
-
-  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
-     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
-     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
-     waiver of all liability.
-
-
-Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
-
-  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
-     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
-     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
-     terminate automatically.
-
-  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
-     Section 6(a), it reinstates:
-
-       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
-          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
-          violation; or
-
-       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
-
-     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
-     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
-     of this Public License.
-
-  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
-     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
-     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
-     will not terminate this Public License.
-
-  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
-     License.
-
-
-Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
-
-  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
-     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
-
-  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
-     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
-     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
-
-
-Section 8 -- Interpretation.
-
-  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
-     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
-     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
-     be made without permission under this Public License.
-
-  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
-     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
-     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
-     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
-     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
-     conditions.
-
-  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
-     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
-     Licensor.
-
-  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
-     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
-     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
-     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

+
+      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
+      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

+      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses

+      as of the date such litigation is filed.

+          the Derivative Works; and
+
+      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed

-## Using this repository
+## Overview
 
-You can run the website locally using Hugo (Extended version), or you can run it in a container runtime. We strongly recommend using the container runtime, as it gives deployment consistency with the live website.
+Hugo is a static HTML and CSS website generator written in [Go][].
+It is optimized for speed, ease of use, and configurability.
+Hugo takes a directory with content and templates and renders them into a full HTML website.
 
-## Prerequisites
+Hugo relies on Markdown files with front matter for metadata, and you can run Hugo from any directory.
+This works well for shared hosts and other systems where you don’t have a privileged account.
 
-To use this repository, you need the following installed locally:
+Hugo renders a typical website of moderate size in a fraction of a second.
+A good rule of thumb is that each piece of content renders in around 1 millisecond.
 
-- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
-- [Go](https://golang.org/)
-- [Hugo (Extended version)](https://gohugo.io/)
-- A container runtime, like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
+Hugo is designed to work well for any kind of website including blogs, tumbles, and docs.
 
-Before you start, install the dependencies. Clone the repository and navigate to the directory:
+#### Supported Architectures
 
-```bash
-git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/website.git
-cd website
-```
-
-The Kubernetes website uses the [Docsy Hugo theme](https://github.com/google/docsy#readme). Even if you plan to run the website in a container, we strongly recommend pulling in the submodule and other development dependencies by running the following:
-
-```bash
-# pull in the Docsy submodule
-git submodule update --init --recursive --depth 1
-```
+Currently, we provide pre-built Hugo binaries for Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly BSD, Open BSD, macOS (Darwin), and [Android](https://gist.github.com/bep/a0d8a26cf6b4f8bc992729b8e50b480b) for x64, i386 and ARM architectures.
 
-## Running the website using a container
+Hugo may also be compiled from source wherever the Go compiler tool chain can run, e.g. for other operating systems including Plan 9 and Solaris.
 
-To build the site in a container, run the following to build the container image and run it:
+**Complete documentation is available at [Hugo Documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/).**
 
-```bash
-make container-image
-make container-serve
-```
-
-If you see errors, it probably means that the hugo container did not have enough computing resources available. To solve it, increase the amount of allowed CPU and memory usage for Docker on your machine ([MacOSX](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#resources) and [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#resources)).
+## Choose How to Install
 
-Open up your browser to <http://localhost:1313> to view the website. As you make changes to the source files, Hugo updates the website and forces a browser refresh.
+If you want to use Hugo as your site generator, simply install the Hugo binaries.
+The Hugo binaries have no external dependencies.
 
-## Running the website locally using Hugo
+To contribute to the Hugo source code or documentation, you should [fork the Hugo GitHub project](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo#fork-destination-box) and clone it to your local machine.
 
-Make sure to install the Hugo extended version specified by the `HUGO_VERSION` environment variable in the [`netlify.toml`](netlify.toml#L10) file.
-
-To build and test the site locally, run:
-
-```bash
-# install dependencies
-npm ci
-make serve
-```
+Finally, you can install the Hugo source code with `go`, build the binaries yourself, and run Hugo that way.
+Building the binaries is an easy task for an experienced `go` getter.
 
-This will start the local Hugo server on port 1313. Open up your browser to <http://localhost:1313> to view the website. As you make changes to the source files, Hugo updates the website and forces a browser refresh.
+### Install Hugo as Your Site Generator (Binary Install)
 
-## Building the API reference pages
+Use the [installation instructions in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).
 
-The API reference pages located in `content/en/docs/reference/kubernetes-api` are built from the Swagger specification, using <https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/reference-docs/tree/master/gen-resourcesdocs>.
+### Build and Install the Binaries from Source (Advanced Install)
 
-To update the reference pages for a new Kubernetes release (replace v1.20 in the following examples with the release to update to):
+#### Prerequisite Tools
 
-1. Pull the `kubernetes-resources-reference` submodule:
+* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
+* [Go (we test it with the last 2 major versions; but note that Hugo 0.81.0 only builds with >= Go 1.16.)](https://golang.org/dl/)
 
-   ```bash
-   git submodule update --init --recursive --depth 1
-   ```
+#### Fetch from GitHub
 
-2. Update the Swagger specification:
+Since Hugo 0.48, Hugo uses the Go Modules support built into Go 1.11 to build. The easiest is to clone Hugo in a directory outside of `GOPATH`, as in the following example:
 
+```bash
+mkdir $HOME/src
+cd $HOME/src
+git clone https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo.git
+cd hugo
+go install
 ```
-curl 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/master/api/openapi-spec/swagger.json' > api-ref-assets/api/swagger.json
-```
-
-3. In `api-ref-assets/config/`, adapt the files `toc.yaml` and `fields.yaml` to reflect the changes of the new release.
-
-4. Next, build the pages:
-
-   ```bash
-   make api-reference
-   ```
-
-   You can test the results locally by making and serving the site from a container image:
-
-   ```bash
-   make container-image
-   make container-serve
-   ```
-
-   In a web browser, go to <http://localhost:1313/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/> to view the API reference.
-
-5. When all changes of the new contract are reflected into the configuration files `toc.yaml` and `fields.yaml`, create a Pull Request with the newly generated API reference pages.
-
-## Troubleshooting
-
-### error: failed to transform resource: TOCSS: failed to transform "scss/main.scss" (text/x-scss): this feature is not available in your current Hugo version
 
-Hugo is shipped in two set of binaries for technical reasons. The current website runs based on the **Hugo Extended** version only. In the [release page](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) look for archives with `extended` in the name. To confirm, run `hugo version` and look for the word `extended`.
+**If you are a Windows user, substitute the `$HOME` environment variable above with `%USERPROFILE%`.**
 
-### Troubleshooting macOS for too many open files
-
-If you run `make serve` on macOS and receive the following error:
+If you want to compile with Sass/SCSS support use `--tags extended` and make sure `CGO_ENABLED=1` is set in your go environment. If you don't want to have CGO enabled, you may use the following command to temporarily enable CGO only for hugo compilation:
 
 ```bash
-ERROR 2020/08/01 19:09:18 Error: listen tcp 127.0.0.1:1313: socket: too many open files
-make: *** [serve] Error 1
+CGO_ENABLED=1 go install --tags extended
 ```
 
-Try checking the current limit for open files:
-
-`launchctl limit maxfiles`
-
-Then run the following commands (adapted from <https://gist.github.com/tombigel/d503800a282fcadbee14b537735d202c>):
-
-```shell
-#!/bin/sh

+## The Hugo Documentation
 
-sudo mv limit.maxfiles.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons
-sudo mv limit.maxproc.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons
+The Hugo documentation now lives in its own repository, see https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs. But we do keep a version of that documentation as a `git subtree` in this repository. To build the sub folder `/docs` as a Hugo site, you need to clone this repo:
 
-sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxfiles.plist
-sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxproc.plist
-
-sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxfiles.plist
+```bash
+git clone git@github.com:gohugoio/hugo.git

-Once your pull request is created, a Kubernetes reviewer will take responsibility for providing clear, actionable feedback. As the owner of the pull request, **it is your responsibility to modify your pull request to address the feedback that has been provided to you by the Kubernetes reviewer.**
-
-Also, note that you may end up having more than one Kubernetes reviewer provide you feedback or you may end up getting feedback from a Kubernetes reviewer that is different than the one initially assigned to provide you feedback.
-
-Furthermore, in some cases, one of your reviewers might ask for a technical review from a Kubernetes tech reviewer when needed. Reviewers will do their best to provide feedback in a timely fashion but response time can vary based on circumstances.
