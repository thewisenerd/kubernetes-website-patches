-Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
-does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
-Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or

-information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no

-
-Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
-
-Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
-conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
-original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
-and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
-following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
-exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
-
-     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
-     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
-     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
-     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
-     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
-     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
-     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
-     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
-     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
-     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
-     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
-     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:

-
-     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
-     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
-     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
-     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
-     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
-     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
-     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
-     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
-     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
-     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
-     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
-     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
-     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
-     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

-     Rights.
-
-  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
-     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws

-     agreements.
-
-  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
-     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
-     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

-     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
-     License.

-     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
-
-  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
-     under this Public License.
-
-  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or

-     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
-     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
-     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
-
-  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
-     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
-
-
-Section 2 -- Scope.
-
-  a. License grant.
-
-       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
-          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
-          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
-          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
-
-            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
-               in part; and
-
-            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
-
-       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
-          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
-          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
-          its terms and conditions.
-
-       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
-          6(a).
-
-       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
-          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
-          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
-          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
-          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
-          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
-          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
-          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
-          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
-          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
-          (4) never produces Adapted Material.
-
-       5. Downstream recipients.
-
-            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
-               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
-               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
-               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
-               Public License.
-
-            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
-               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
-               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
-               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
-               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
-               Material.
-
-       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
-          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
-          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
-          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
-          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
-          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
-
-  b. Other rights.
-
-       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
-          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
-          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
-          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
-          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
-          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
-          Rights, but not otherwise.
-
-       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
-          Public License.
-
-       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
-          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
-          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
-          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
-          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
-          reserves any right to collect such royalties.
-
-
-Section 3 -- License Conditions.
-
-Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
-following conditions.
-
-  a. Attribution.
-
-       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
-          form), You must:
-
-            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
-               with the Licensed Material:
-
-                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
-                    Material and any others designated to receive
-                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
-                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
-                    designated);
-
-                ii. a copyright notice;
-
-               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
-
-                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
-                    warranties;
-
-                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
-                    extent reasonably practicable;
-
-            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
-               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
-
-            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
-               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
-               hyperlink to, this Public License.
-
-       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
-          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
-          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
-          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
-          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
-          information.
-
-       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
-          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
-          reasonably practicable.
-
-       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
-          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
-          Material from complying with this Public License.
-
-
-Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
-
-Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
-apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
-
-  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
-     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
-     portion of the contents of the database;
-
-  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
-     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
-     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
-     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
-
-  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
-     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
-
-For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
-replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
-Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
-
-
-Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
-
-  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
-     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
-     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
-     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
-     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
-     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
-     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
-     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
-     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
-     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
-
-  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
-     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
-     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
-     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
-     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
-     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
-     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
-     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
-     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
-
-  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
-     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
-     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
-     waiver of all liability.
-
-
-Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
-
-  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
-     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
-     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
-     terminate automatically.
-
-  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
-     Section 6(a), it reinstates:
-
-       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
-          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
-          violation; or
-
-       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
-
-     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
-     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
-     of this Public License.
-
-  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
-     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
-     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
-     will not terminate this Public License.
-
-  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
-     License.
-
-
-Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
-
-  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
-     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
-
-  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
-     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
-     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
-
-
-Section 8 -- Interpretation.
-
-  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
-     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
-     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
-     be made without permission under this Public License.
-
-  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
-     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
-     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
-     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
-     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
-     conditions.
-
-  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
-     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
-     Licensor.
-
-  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
-     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
-     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
-     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

+
+      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
+      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
+      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
+      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
+      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

+      as of the date such litigation is filed.

+[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/gohugoio/hugo)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/gohugoio/hugo)
 
-You can run the website locally using Hugo (Extended version), or you can run it in a container runtime. We strongly recommend using the container runtime, as it gives deployment consistency with the live website.
+## Overview
 
-## Prerequisites
+Hugo is a static HTML and CSS website generator written in [Go][].
+It is optimized for speed, ease of use, and configurability.
+Hugo takes a directory with content and templates and renders them into a full HTML website.
 
-To use this repository, you need the following installed locally:
+Hugo relies on Markdown files with front matter for metadata, and you can run Hugo from any directory.
+This works well for shared hosts and other systems where you don’t have a privileged account.
 
-- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
-- [Go](https://golang.org/)
-- [Hugo (Extended version)](https://gohugo.io/)
-- A container runtime, like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
+Hugo renders a typical website of moderate size in a fraction of a second.
+A good rule of thumb is that each piece of content renders in around 1 millisecond.
 
-Before you start, install the dependencies. Clone the repository and navigate to the directory:
+Hugo is designed to work well for any kind of website including blogs, tumbles, and docs.
 
-```
-git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/website.git
-cd website
-```
+#### Supported Architectures
 
-The Kubernetes website uses the [Docsy Hugo theme](https://github.com/google/docsy#readme). Even if you plan to run the website in a container, we strongly recommend pulling in the submodule and other development dependencies by running the following:
+Currently, we provide pre-built Hugo binaries for Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly BSD, Open BSD, macOS (Darwin), and [Android](https://gist.github.com/bep/a0d8a26cf6b4f8bc992729b8e50b480b) for x64, i386 and ARM architectures.
 
-```
-# pull in the Docsy submodule
-git submodule update --init --recursive --depth 1
-```
+Hugo may also be compiled from source wherever the Go compiler tool chain can run, e.g. for other operating systems including Plan 9 and Solaris.
 
-## Running the website using a container
+**Complete documentation is available at [Hugo Documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/).**
 
-To build the site in a container, run the following to build the container image and run it:
+## Choose How to Install
 
-```
-make container-image
-make container-serve
-```
-
-Open up your browser to http://localhost:1313 to view the website. As you make changes to the source files, Hugo updates the website and forces a browser refresh.
+If you want to use Hugo as your site generator, simply install the Hugo binaries.
+The Hugo binaries have no external dependencies.
 
-## Running the website locally using Hugo
+To contribute to the Hugo source code or documentation, you should [fork the Hugo GitHub project](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo#fork-destination-box) and clone it to your local machine.
 
-Make sure to install the Hugo extended version specified by the `HUGO_VERSION` environment variable in the [`netlify.toml`](netlify.toml#L10) file.
+Finally, you can install the Hugo source code with `go`, build the binaries yourself, and run Hugo that way.
+Building the binaries is an easy task for an experienced `go` getter.
 
-To build and test the site locally, run:
+### Install Hugo as Your Site Generator (Binary Install)
 
-```bash
-# install dependencies
-npm ci
-make serve
-```
+Use the [installation instructions in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).
 
-This will start the local Hugo server on port 1313. Open up your browser to http://localhost:1313 to view the website. As you make changes to the source files, Hugo updates the website and forces a browser refresh.
+### Build and Install the Binaries from Source (Advanced Install)
 
-## Troubleshooting
-### error: failed to transform resource: TOCSS: failed to transform "scss/main.scss" (text/x-scss): this feature is not available in your current Hugo version
+#### Prerequisite Tools
 
-Hugo is shipped in two set of binaries for technical reasons. The current website runs based on the **Hugo Extended** version only. In the [release page](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) look for archives with `extended` in the name. To confirm, run `hugo version` and look for the word `extended`.
+* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
+* [Go (we test it with the last 2 major versions)](https://golang.org/dl/)
 
-### Troubleshooting macOS for too many open files
+#### Fetch from GitHub
 
-If you run `make serve` on macOS and receive the following error:
+Since Hugo 0.48, Hugo uses the Go Modules support built into Go 1.11 to build. The easiest is to clone Hugo in a directory outside of `GOPATH`, as in the following example:
 
+```bash
+mkdir $HOME/src
+cd $HOME/src
+git clone https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo.git
+cd hugo
+go install
 ```
-ERROR 2020/08/01 19:09:18 Error: listen tcp 127.0.0.1:1313: socket: too many open files
-make: *** [serve] Error 1
-```
-
-Try checking the current limit for open files:
 
-`launchctl limit maxfiles`
+**If you are a Windows user, substitute the `$HOME` environment variable above with `%USERPROFILE%`.**
 
-Then run the following commands (adapted from https://gist.github.com/tombigel/d503800a282fcadbee14b537735d202c):
+If you want to compile with Sass/SCSS support use `--tags extended` and make sure `CGO_ENABLED=1` is set in your go environment. If you don't want to have CGO enabled, you may use the following command to temporarily enable CGO only for hugo compilation:
 
+```bash
+CGO_ENABLED=1 go install --tags extended
 ```

+## The Hugo Documentation
 
-sudo mv limit.maxfiles.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons
-sudo mv limit.maxproc.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons
+The Hugo documentation now lives in its own repository, see https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs. But we do keep a version of that documentation as a `git subtree` in this repository. To build the sub folder `/docs` as a Hugo site, you need to clone this repo:
 
-sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxfiles.plist
-sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxproc.plist
-
-sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxfiles.plist
+```bash
+git clone git@github.com:gohugoio/hugo.git
 ```

-This works for Catalina as well as Mojave macOS.
